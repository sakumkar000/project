  <p>Japan is probably on almost everyone's list of travel destinations. There are so many cool places to explore and discover in Japan. But what makes such a cool and interesting place? Here are only 8 of the many fun places that make Japan such an amazing place to visit.</p>
 <h2>1. Fuji-Q Highland</h2>
  <p>Almost every country has an amusement park, but is it as awesome as Fuji-Q Highland? At this amusement park, the roller coasters here are crazy. Some don't have a bottom so it feels like you're flying, some go inverted and upside and some even flip backwords and upside down. They hold over 14 guinness world records and build a new roller coaster every 5 years.</p>

  <h2>2. Cat Island</h2>
  <p>Another interesting place in Japan that every cat lover (including me) really should visit is the Cat Island located in the Myagi prefecture (which is located North of Tokyo). This island called Tashirojima is inhabited by cats. There are more than a hundred stray cats roaming the streets of the island. There is even a shrine for the cats! A cool fact is that there are about 11 cat islands across Japan, but Tashirojima is the biggest island with the highest cat population.</p>

  <h2>3. Zao Fox Village</h2>
  <p>Another great place for any animal lovers, especially for those who wants to get close to a wild animal. At this fox village, adorable foxes and other animals roam around where you can get close to one and even touch one, which is certainly a rare chance since foxes are so sneaky. </p>

  <h2>4. Cup Noodle Museum</h2>
  <p>The Cup Noodle Museum is heaven for anyone who loves instant ramen. At the Cup Noodle museum you can find just about any flavor of cup noodle there is and you can even build your own cup of noodle. You can learn more about the history of cup noodles and tour through all the interesting exhibits.</p>

  <h2>5. Wisteria Tunnel</h2>
  <p>This wisteria tunnel located in Kyushu might just be one of the most beautiful and magical places on Earth. The beautiful purple wisteria flowers create a wonderful and dream-like experience for everyone who walks through this tunnel. This would especially be great for any plant lovers or anyone that just loves beautiful scenery and nature.</p>

  <h2>6. Battleship Island</h2>
  <p>Hashima Island became known as "battleship island" for it's distinct battleship looking shape. This island is now an abandoned ghost-like island with all the buildings and everything left untouched. During World War II, this island was inhabited with many people and used as a coal mining facility. However, when coal mining declined, everyone on the island was evacuated to the mainland. Today this island is a popular attraction in Japan. It's a great place to witness the history of Japan during the War.</p>

  <h2>7. Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine</h2>
  <p>This next place is a little different from the previous places and is more towards anyone interested in traditional Japanese architecture and culture. This shrine located in Kyoto is one of the most famous and important shrines in Japan. What makes this shrine different from the rest is the unique idea of having the entrance at the base of a mountain and a pathway with red gates called torii up the mountain to the main shrine.</p>

  <h2>8. Character and Theme Cafes</h2>
  <p>This next attraction is not a particular place but many places in general. Meaning there are many places to find these fun cafes all across Japan. Themed cafes first began when a cafe for a anime show was opened. This cafe became very popular that cafes from other iconic characters like Hello Kitty, Pokemon and even Alice in Wonderland were made as well. This idea even extended to make animal cafes like cat cafes and dog cafes and even hedgehog cafes. One of the reasons why animal cafes were opened was for people who likes animals but couldn't afford a pet get a chance to play and be around animals.</p>
