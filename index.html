 <h1>3 reasons why cats are the best pet to own!</h1>
  <p>Here are just 3 of the many reasons why cats are one of the best pets to own</p>
 <h2>Reason #1: They are easy to take care of.</h2>
  <p>One reason why cats are the best is because they are very easy to take care of. Unlike dogs, they don't require you to walk them everyday or keep your attention on them all the time. This is very convenient especially when you are busy and don't have time to play with them. Most cats just spend their time napping or doing their own thing.</p>
  <h2>Reason #2: They are very quiet</h2>
  <p>Another reason why cats are great is because they are very quiet. They rarely whine or cry unless they want attention and even if they do meow, their vocal sounds aren't that loud and it doesn't get that annoying.</p>
  <h2>Reason #3: They are great pillows or cuddlers.</h2>
  <p>One great physical appearance about most cats are their fluffy and or soft fur. Their fur is just so soft and fluffy that it feels nice and comforting when they sleep with you or when you want to hold them. This also allows them to be able to sleep anywhere comfortably.</p>
