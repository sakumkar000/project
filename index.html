  <h1>The Best Places to Visit When Travelling to Japan</h1> <img src= "http://businesseventstokyo.org/uploads/2013/05/tokyo_map.png" alt="Japan Map" style="float:right;width:280px;height:270px;"/>
  <p>Here are only 8 of the many fun and interesting places in Japan that you might consider going when visiting Japan.</p>
 <h2>1. Fuji-Q Highland</h2>
  <p>Almost every country has an amusement park, but is it as awesome as Fuji-Q Highland? At this amusement, the roller coasters here are crazy. Some don't have a bottom so it feels like you're flying, some go inverted and upside and some even flip backwords and upside down. They hold over 14 guinness world records and build a new roller coaster every 5 years.</p>

  <h2>2. Cat Island</h2>
  <p>Another interesting place in Japan that every cat lover (including me) really should visit is the Cat Island located in the Myagi prefecture (which is located North of Tokyo). This island called Tashirojima is inhabited by cats. There are more than a hundred stray cats roaming the streets of island. There is even a shrine for the cats! A cool fact is that there are about 11 cat islands across Japan, but Tashirojima is the biggest island with the highest cat population.</p>

  <h2>3. Zao Fox Village</h2>
  <p>Another great place for any animal lovers, especially for those who wants to get close to a wild animal. At this fox village, adorable foxes, as well as other animals roam around where you can get close to one and even touch one, which is certainly a rare chance since foxes are so sneaky. </p>

  <h2>5. Wisteria Tunnel</h2>
  <p>This tunnel located in Kyushu in the most southwestern part of Japan might just be one of the most beautiful and magical places on Earth.

  <h2>6. Battleship Island</h2>
  <p>Hashima Island became known as "battleship island" for it's distinct battleship looking shape. This island is now an abandoned ghost-like island with all the buildings and everything left untouched. During World War II, this island has inhabited with many people and used as a coal mining facility. However when coal mining decline everyone on the island were evacuated and was left deserted. Now this island is a popular attraction in Japan. It's a great place to witness the history of Japan during the War.</p>

  <h2>7. Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine</h2>
  <p>This next place is a little different from the previous places and is more towards anyone interested in traditional Japanese architecture and culture. This shrine located in Kyoto is one of the most famous and important shrines in Japan. What makes this shrine different from the rest is the unique idea of having the entrance at the base of a mountain and a pathway with red gates called torii up the mountain to the main shrine.</p>
