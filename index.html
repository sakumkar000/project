  <p>Here are just 5 of the many reasons why cats are one of the best pets to own</p>
 <h2>Reason #1: They don't require much work and are easy to take care of.</h2>
  <p>One reason why cats are the best is because they are very easy to take care of. Unlike dogs, they don't require you to walk them everyday or keep your attention on them all the time. This is very convenient especially when you are busy and don't have time to play with them. The only work cats require is to feed them, clean the litter, bathe them once in a while and to make sure they are happy.</p>
  <h2>Reason #2: They are very quiet</h2>
  <p>Another reason why cats are great is because they are very quiet. Compared to dogs, cats are rather more quiet than them. They rarely whine or cry unless they want attention and even if they do meow, their vocal sounds aren't that loud and it doesn't get that annoying. Cats mostly just nap throughout the day or spend their time doing their own things by themselves quietly like staring out the window.</p>
  <h2>Reason #3: They don't take up a lot of space in your house</h2>
  <p>Cats can basically sleep anywhere they feel is comfortable to them, which is why they don't take up a lot of space. There is no need to buy a bed or set aside their own personal space because they will just sleep and play around anywhere.</p>
  <h2>Reason #4: They are fun to play with.</h2>
   <p>Even though it may seem that cats are known for sleeping all the time, cats are in fact very active and extremely fun to play with, especially if you have a laser pointer, which makes them go crazy.</p>
  <h2>Reason #5: They are great cuddlers.</h2>
 <p>One great physical appearance about most cats are their fluffy and or soft fur. Their fur is just so soft and fluffy that it feels nice and comforting when they sleep with you or when you want to hold them. This also allows them to be able to sleep anywhere comfortably.</p>
